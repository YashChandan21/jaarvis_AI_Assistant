Hello Dev's...
I have created a intermediate python project.
In this project I have made a 'Jarvis AI Assitant'.
Which is fully on python functions and its libraries.
I have import python library such as ...
1. pyttsx3 - For text to speech conversion.
2. SpeechRecognition - To convert audio to text.
3. pywhatkit - To interact with browser.
4. wikipedia - To gain information from wikipedia online.
5. requests - HTTP used.
6. python-decouple - Used to config data.

To install this library used command 'pip install library_name' on your terminal.
Also , download setuptools library, to avoid pyaudio or no module  distutils error on your code.

This project, I have created on virtual environment, you can also used your current environment.

Thank you for reading and analysing my Project.
If there is any type of correction you have, you can make it.
